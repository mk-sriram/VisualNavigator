# VisualNavigator
tools to keep your hands where they belong ( on the 'key'-board  ) . Use your eyes to move the cursor instead.


--Current Idea--
1. train/use a CV model to track eye movements, calibrated to the dimentions of your screen
2. Vim motions + shortcuts to toggle between movement and editing modes
3. use the data to improve the model
